        who Rasool Allah ﷺ is and learning about the gifts and guidance that he offered
         the world. They decided to travel overseas to attain the love of the Messenger ﷺ, 
         finding it to be prevalent in the art of traditional Inshād (spiritual odes). They 
         dedicated themselves to years of intensive study and training with some of the 
         greatest Munshideen (masters of spiritual odes) of the modern era from Syria and 
         Jordan. Their teachers include Shaykh Samer Nashar, Shaykh Muhammad Adel, Shaykh 
         Jihad Al-Kalouti, Shaykh Abdullah Adel, Shaykh Abdulrahman Sha’ar, Shaykh Salah 
         Al-Kurdy, and Ustadh Omar Helal.

      <h1>Abdul-Majeed Abugideiri</h1>
      <p>Abdul-Majeed Abugideiri has been studying the art of traditional
        inshad and singing intensively since he was five years old in Amman,
        Jordan. His parents and Qur’an teachers realized early on that he had
        a special talent for music and singing. He has studied for the past
        15 years with some of the most prominent munshideen (nasheed singers)
        from Shaam (Levant Region); under their tutelage, he sang in various
        zawiyas and performed at various events throughout Jordan and internationally.
        Some of the countries Abdul Majeed has performed in include, Egypt, Turkey, Bosnia,
        Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Canada, Jordan, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
        Abdul-Majeed now resides in California and hopes to spread his love for traditional
        spiritual poetry and the praises of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ throughout the world.</p>

      <h1>Ibrahim Khan</h1>
      <p>Ibrahim Khan was born and raised in Southern California. At the age of 13,
        he moved to Amman, Jordan, to study the traditional Islamic sciences.
        He quickly discovered a passion for traditional inshad and started
        studying with various munshideen (nasheed singers). Along with singing,
        Ibrahim studied hand-drumming intensively. For over five years in Jordan,
        Ibrahim has been drumming at mawlids, weddings, and other religious events.
        He is the lead drummer for Ahbab Al-Habib. You can always find him with a duff
        (hand drum) in hand. Ibrahim currently resides in California where he sings
        with Ahbab Al-Habib and performs at mawlids and events to help spread the
        love of the Prophet ﷺ.</p>

      <h1>Shaan Mukhtar</h1>
      <p>Shaan Mukhtar grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area where at a very
        young age he was exposed to mawlids and traditional Islamic poetry.
        With the encouragement of his teachers, Shaan took a gap year during
        college to go to Jordan to study Arabic and inshad. There, he met
        Abdul-Majeed and Ibrahim and started learning classical singing from
        them and their teachers. For one year, Shaan studied in Jordan extensively.
        He has now returned to California where he sings at mawlids and events
        throughout the Bay Area. </p>
